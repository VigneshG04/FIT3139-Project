Base Model: Lotka-Volterra in Discrete Time

Extension:
 - Stochastic Lotka-Volterra Model

Showcase:
 - Gillespie's Algorithm: Stochastic simulation in discrete Time
 - Game Theory: The predator and prey can take risks, which may increase or decrease their ability to survive

Questions:
 - How does randomness affect the survival outcomes of predator/prey?
 - How does the behaviour of predator/prey affect their survival ability?
