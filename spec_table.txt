Base Model: Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma

Extension:
 - Simulate several rounds of the iterated prisoner's dillema with evolving strategies

Showcase:
 - Game Theory (Trying different set strategies)
 - Monte Carlo Simulation (Simulating random choices/strategies)
 Maybe these two can go together?
 - Can maybe do heuristics (how to?)

Questions:
 - What is the optimal strategy for individual outcomes?
 - ?
